# Java-OOP-project-

## Project Overview  
This project implements three Java classes — **Teacher**, **Lecturer**, and **Tutor** — using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. Each class represents a different educational role with unique attributes and functions. The project demonstrates practical OOP concepts applied in real-world scenarios.

## Objectives  
- Design and implement Java classes modeling educational roles  
- Use OOP principles like inheritance and encapsulation  
- Write clear pseudocode and detailed method explanations  
- Test the classes thoroughly and handle errors (syntax, semantic, logical)  
- Document the entire development and testing process  

## Contents  
- Introduction and background  
- Tools used for development  
- Class diagrams for Teacher, Lecturer, Tutor, and inheritance structure  
- Pseudocode and method descriptions  
- Testing results with error detection and fixes  
- Conclusion and references  

## Key Learnings  
- Applying OOP principles in Java  
- Designing class hierarchies with inheritance  
- Debugging and error handling in Java programs  
- Documenting software development comprehensively  

## How to Run  
- Open the project in any Java IDE (BlueJ, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA)  
- Compile and run the Java classes  
- Follow test cases described in the report for validation
